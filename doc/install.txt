# Install Rhodes

## Installing Rhodes with RhoStudio

The most common way to install Rhodes on a Windows or Macintosh platform is to install RhoMobile Suite. The RhoMobile Suite installer installs Rho products, such as Rhodes, RhoConnect, RhoElements, and RhoStudio. RhoStudio is an Eclipse installation that facilitates development of native smartphone applications.

[Click here for the RhoMobile Suite installation instructions](/rhomobile-install). 

NOTE: The rest of this chapter consists of instructions for installing Rhodes from the command line, without using the RhoMobile Suite installer. You do not need to perform those instructions if you installed using the RhoMobile Suite installer.

## Installing Rhodes from the Command Line

To install Rhodes on Linux, and to install Rhodes on Windows or Mac OS using the command line (this does not install the RhoStudio IDE), you need to install the Rhodes gem. Download and install:

1. [Ruby v1.9.3](http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/).

	* On Windows, [RubyInstaller](http://rubyinstaller.org) is a convenient way to install Ruby; you should check "Add Ruby executables to your PATH" and "Associate .rb and .rbw files with this Ruby installation".
    
	* On Macintosh, Ruby is already installed, but this version is outdated and isn't compatible with RhoStudio: install [Ruby Version Manager](https://rvm.io//) (RVM) and then use RVM to install Ruby version 1.9.3.

2. Install the Rhodes Gem. 

	Run this command to install the Rhodes Gem.

		:::term
  		$ [sudo] gem install rhodes

NOTE: If you get any `no such file to load -- something` messages while running the rake tasks or rhodes commands, this can usually be resolved by putting "sudo" in front of the command, as in `sudo gem install something`.

NOTE: Windows doesn't come with the necessary build tools to install gems ('make', for example). There are various ways to get these tools, but the GnuWin32 project at http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/ provides the tools, and can be installed via the GetGnuWin32 installer at http://sourceforge.net/projects/getgnuwin32/files/. You should follow the GetGnuWin32 instructions carefully.

## Setup Rhodes SDKs

Once you have Rhodes, you will need the SDKs for the platform you want to build your app on. These instructions are found [here](build).

After you install the gem and your desired SDKs, you need to run:

	:::term
	$ rhodes-setup

This will prompt you for where you installed the SDKs for the various platforms.  The installation script will display its best guess as to where the SDK is. You can then enter a new location, or leave it blank to use the suggestion. If you are not building for a specific platform (for example, you can't build for the iPhone on Windows), you can leave that SDK location blank. You can find prerequisites for each platform [here](build#all-platforms-prerequisites).

## Setting the JDK Path in Command Line Installations

For Linux and for Rhodes installs from the command line, set the JDK path in JAVA_HOME and PATH.
