# Install Rhodes

## Mac OS

If you're running Mac OS, download the latest [MotorolaRhoMobileSuite Installer for Macintosh](http://rhomobile.com/rhostudio-mac). This contains [Redis](http://redis.io/), [RhoConnect](/rhoconnect/introduction) and [Rhodes](/rhodes/introduction).

Although Mac OS has [Ruby](http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) installed, the official way to install Ruby for RhoStudio is to install [Ruby Version Manager](https://rvm.io//) and then install Ruby version 1.9.3.

Click on the MotorolaRhoMobileSuite Installer for Mac download file to open it. You will get a window similar to this:

<img src="http://rhodocs.s3.amazonaws.com/rhodes-devel/rhostudio-mac-install.png" alt="RhoStudioInstaller Mac" />

Run "Install gems on rvm" (this requires that you have installed Ruby Version Manager). A terminal window will open; wait for the gems install process to complete.

Then drag Motorola RhoStudio to the Applications folder.

**NOTE: Installing Ruby into the System folder is not supported by RhoMobile; the official RhoMobile way to install and use Ruby on the Macintosh is with Ruby Version Manager. If you do not use Ruby Version Manager and instead install Ruby into the System folder, you will need to start and run RhoStudio from the command line using sudo.**

## Windows

If you're running Windows, download and run the latest [MotorolaRhoMobileSuite Installer for Windows](http://rhomobile.com/rhostudio-windows) and run it. This installs the [Ruby stack](http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/), [Redis](http://redis.io/), [RhoConnect](/rhoconnect/introduction) and [Rhodes](/rhodes/introduction).

If you are running Windows 64-bit, you need to use 32-bit Java when you run RhoStudio. You can include the 32-bit Java in the PATH, or you can run RhoStudio with a link to 32-bit Java:

	C:\RhoStudio\eclipse\RhoStudio.exe -vm "<32-bit java path>\bin\javaw.exe"

Once the installer has completed, and you have installed the Java Development Kit, you can skip to the [Setup Rhodes section](#setup-rhodes).

## Java Development Kit (JDK)

You need to have the Java Development Kit (JDK) installed for RhoStudio. If you are planning to build for Blackberry or Android, make sure you have JDK version 1.6.0_2 or higher installed; the 32-bit Windows version of the JDK is required for Blackberry tools.

### Installing the Java Development Kit

The Sun JDK for Windows or Linux is available [here](http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/index.jsp). For Windows, install the 32-bit version of the JDK; RhoStudio needs the 32-bit version.

For Mac OS 10.6 and earlier, the JDK is already installed. For Mac OS 10.7, Java is not automatically installed. Download the Java for Mac Installer from [Apple support](http://support.apple.com/kb/DL1421) and install Java.

NOTE: To build for Android it is required JDK 1.6 (JDK 1.7 is not supported)

### Setting the JDK Path

On Windows installs for RhoMobile, go to RhoStudio Preferences (Windows -> Preferences) and set the JDK path in the rhobuild.yml file. On Windows 64-bit installations, you must set this path to the 32-bit version of the JDK, such as `C:/Program Files (x86)/Java/jdk<version number>/bin`.

On Mac OS, the path to the JDK is automatically set once Java is installed.

For Linux and for Rhodes installs from the command line, set the JDK path in JAVA_HOME and PATH.

## Installing Rhodes from the Command Line

To install Rhodes on Linux, and to install Rhodes on Windows or Mac OS using the command line (this does not install RhoStudio), you need to install the Rhodes gem. Download and install:

1. [Ruby v1.9.3](http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/) (On Windows, [RubyInstaller](http://rubyinstaller.org) is a convenient way to install Ruby; you should check "Add Ruby executables to your PATH" and "Associate .rb and .rbw files with this Ruby installation".)

2. Install the Rhodes Gem. Run this command to install.

	:::term
  	$ [sudo] gem install rhodes

NOTE: If you get any `no such file to load -- something` messages while running the rake tasks or rhodes commands, this can usually be resolved by putting "sudo" in front of the command, as in `sudo gem install something`.

NOTE: Windows doesn't come with the necessary build tools to install gems ('make', for example). There are various ways to get these tools, but the GnuWin32 project at http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/ provides the tools, and can be installed via the GetGnuWin32 installer at http://sourceforge.net/projects/getgnuwin32/files/. You should follow the GetGnuWin32 instructions carefully.

You can [install RhoStudio as a plugin for Eclipse](rhostudio-eclipse).

RhoSimulator, which comes with RhoStudio for Mac and Windows, does not work with Linux.

## Setup Rhodes

Once you have Rhodes, you will need the SDKs for the platform you want to build your app on. These instructions are found [here](build).

If you are not using RhoStudio, after you install the gem and your desired SDKs, you need to run:

	:::term
	$ rhodes-setup

This will prompt you for where you installed the SDKs for the various platforms.  The installation script will display its best guess as to where the SDK is. You can then enter a new location, or leave it blank to use the suggestion. If you are not building for a specific platform (for example, you can't build for the iPhone on Windows), you can leave that SDK location blank. You can find prerequisites for each platform [here](build#all-platforms-prerequisites).

If you are using RhoStudio, you can either run rhodes-setup, or you can set the SDK paths in RhoStudio Preferences.

## Setting the Location of the RhoStudio Workspace Directory

When you start RhoStudio, you can set the location of the workspace directory. The path to the workspace directory should not contain space symbols: if the path has spaces, a RhoConnect application created with RhoStudio will not work properly.

## Standalone Ruby Installation and Ruby Version Manager

Do not install Ruby as a standalone if you also use Ruby Version Manager (rvm) to install Ruby. If you need only one version of Ruby, you can install Ruby as a standalone. If you need more than one version of Ruby, you should uninstall standalone Ruby and then install Ruby with Ruby Version Manager. Mixed standalone Ruby and rvm-controlled Ruby installations can conflict and cause runtime issues in Rhodes applications.
